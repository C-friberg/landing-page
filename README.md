The project was a part of The Odin projects flexbox tutorial. 
As of 31st of May, im not completely finished with everything, but im gonna resume my The Odin Project learning and jump on to JavaScript. 

It was a great excercise for learning flexbox and altough I still find it difficult, I still think I learned much.
